            <p>Sarah has a booking at a small inn. The inn is in a quiet town on a hill. She takes a flight to the town. The fare is fifty dollars. The flight is two hours long.</p>

            <p>Sarah arrives at the inn at 1 PM. She checks in with a friendly woman. "Thank you for your help," she says to the woman at the desk. Her bedroom is small but very nice. The bedroom has a big window. The shower works well and the water is hot. She locks the door with her key. The door is unlocked when she wants to go out.</p>
            <p>Sarah is hungry after the long flight. She wants a good meal and a cold drink. She goes to a restaurant near the inn. She pays with cash. The food is very good and fresh.</p>
            <p>After the meal, Sarah goes sightseeing in the town. She walks to the beautiful shore. The view is amazing. She takes many photos with her phone. The Wi-Fi at the inn works well, so she sends the photos to her family. She also reads her guidebook about the town.</p>

            <p>"Sorry, where is the washroom, please?" she asks a man on the road. He is very kind and shows her the way.</p>
            <p>The next day Sarah checks out at 12 PM. She takes the coach to the railway station. She likes this peaceful hill town very much. She wants to come back next year.</p>
